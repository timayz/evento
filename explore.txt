// internal pub sub for projection with mpsc chanel that send message if handler return Some(mesaage)


proc macro to generate comman deref, load, struct...
add missing data() on subscription
add no_event_filter to LoadBuilder to disable filter by event name since we need all events for load (event sourcing) but not for subscription
maybe load_view to enable event filter ?
